A simple software system for a Library models a library as a collection of books and patrons.  A patron can have at most 3 books out on loan at any given time.  Each book has a title, an author, a patron to whom it has been checked out, and a list of patrons waiting for that book to be returned.  When a patron wants to borrow a book, that patron is automatically added to the book's wait list if the book is already checked out.  When a patron returns a book, it is automatically loaned to the first patron on its wait list who can check out a book.  Each patron has a name and a number of books that patron has currently checked out.  Develop the classes Book and Patron to model these objects.  Think first of the interface or set of methods to be used with each class, and then choose appropriate data structures for the state of the objects.  Also write a short script to test these classes.

Develop a Library class that can manage the books and patrons.  This class should include methods for adding, removing, and finding books and patrons.
