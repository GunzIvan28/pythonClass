Month | Current Total | Interest Amount | Principal | Payment | Balance Remaining 

Month 			=	Generated from loop in main.
Current Total 	= 	
Total Payment 	=	acc.monPay * loopValue (aka i in for loop)

Balance remaining = Calculate total payment by multiplying it against [0-12],
					subtract that from starting price in each iteration.

for i in xrange(0, 12):
	print i, acc.currentTotal, acc.intAmount, acc.principal, acc.monPay, acc.currentTotal - (acc.payment * i)

In order of instantiation:
Rates:
	Attributes:
		Down Payment Rate:
			rate.downPayRate = .10
		Monthly Interest Rate:
			rate.monIntRate = .01
		Monthly Payment Rate:  	
			rate.monPayRate = .05

Account:
	Attributes:
		Base Price:
			item.basePrice = (Input)
		Down Payment:	
			item.downPay = item.basePrice * rate.downPayRate
		Interest Amount:
			item.intAmount = item.basePrice * rate.monIntRate
		Starting Price:
			item.startPrice = item.basePrice - item.downPay
		Principal:
			item.principal = item.startPrice * rate.monPayRate
		Monthly Payment:
			item.payment = item.principal + item.intAmount
		Current Total:
			acc.currentTotal = acc.currentTotal - item.payment
		Remaining Balance:
			acc.balRemain

Monthly static:
	acc.intAmount
	acc.principal
	acc.payment

Monthly vary:
	acc.currentTotal
	acc.balRemain

Interest is before Down Payment.
Monthly Payment is after down payment.

Program takes PRICE.
	Item (method) sets BASEPRICE; calculates and sets DOWNPAYMENT, INTERESTAMOUNT, STARTPRICE, PRINCIPAL, and MONTHLYPAYMENT; and returns the STARTPRICE.
		Account (method) accepts STARTPRICE and sets CURRENTTOTAL.
